**
** The teleport function will go through the door list to find the associated
** teleport destination, and then retrieve its coordinates and make them the
** player's coordinates.
**
** Just input the x and y coordinates of a normal door as the first two
** arguments and the x and y coordinates of a special '*' door as the last two
